# PHP4-constructor-migrate
Script to migrate from PHP4 type constructor to PHP5+ type

### Warning
* This is not a perfect tool, after running it you need to verify that everything works
* This will change the formating of your script, and will make diffs show more than the new constructor

git clone git@github.com:Lilleengen/PHP4-constructor-migrate.git
cd PHP4-constructor-migrate
composer install
```

### Usage
```bash
php /path/to/php4-constructor-migrate.php
